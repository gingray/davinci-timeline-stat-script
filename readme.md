## Davinci Resolve script
there two scripts 
* timeline-stat.py
* render-each-clip-on-timeline.py

`timeline-stat.py` - stat for you timeline  
`render-each-clip-on-timeline.py` - render each clip individually on timeline (timeline  name should be'render_each')
and save it in mp4 format using codec H.264 in you default export directory. Name of video will be the same as name of the clip
